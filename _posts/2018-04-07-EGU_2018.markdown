I'll be presenting my work on Analaog Data Assimilation with applications to SLA reconstruction from along-track nadir and pseudo-SWOT data as a poster at EGU 2018 in Vienna, Austria. I'm looking forward to meeting fellow scientists and discussing my work during the poster session on Ocean Remote Sensing (Monday 04/09, 17:30-19:00). Come see my poster at stand X4.184. Cheers!
